Image Database
The problem is simple:
*"…have a large number of images; thousands, scattered across numerous drives.
I have no idea where they all are…"*
By dropping the drive onto Terminal or BBEdit you can get a listing of the drive and save that as plain-text which is going to last, it's not tied to a propritaory format. At worst converted into a /CSV file.

Text files are easy to manipulate, search, store, human and machine read. It's just the orgainsing of them that is the issue.
