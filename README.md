Image Database
The problem is simple:
*"…have a large number of images; thousands, scattered across numerous drives.
I have no idea where they all are…"*,

Lets say I need to find all the pictures taken in Venice for a project, which I do. Each image folder is going to contain the word 'Venice' so we just need to query all the disk listings to find entries for Venice of which there will be a few.

By dropping the drive onto Terminal or [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) (other text editors are available), you can get a listing of the drive and save that as plain-text which is going to last, it's not tied to a propritaory format. At worst converted into a /CSV file.

Text files are easy to manipulate, search, store, human and machine read. It's just the orgainsing of them that is the issue.

The information also needs to include things like drive name, physical location, interfaces, is there a backup? Are these original RAW files or JPEG exports? dates.

Doesn't really need to include the individual file names as these don't really mean much and rotate every 10,000 frames.
